# Python-ML-Projects
# Advertisement Classification ML Model

## Introduction
In order to develop a model to predict who will click on an advertisement on a website in the future based on user behaviour and profile information, the case study aims to apply machine learning to historical data of advertisement clicks.

## Process of Creating a ML Model
The flow of the case study is as below:

- Reading the data in python
- Defining the problem statement
- Identifying the Target variable
- Looking at the distribution of Target variable
- Basic Data exploration
- Rejecting useless columns
- Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)
- Feature Selection based on data distribution
- Visual correlation analysis
- Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)
- Converting data to numeric for ML
- Classification Logistic Regression
